ZECertAuthPanel is a new lightweight panel for ssl certificate management

## What is it?
It is the most simple and the most light-weight ssl management server

## What system requirements do I need?
1. **OS:** Linux (or maybe docker)
2. Libraries and utilities:
    * php version >= 7.3 (maybe works with previous versions)
    * openssl library and openssl command line tool
    * php-mysql or php-pdo or php-sqlite (in the primary release (1.0.0-alha))

## How secure is it?
Now it is the beta version of this program product. It has minimal security influences. At this time it uses jajo/JSONDB to store users credentials. In future versions it tends to be mysql, sqlite or something even more secure.

## You want to create a new product out of this beta?
Ok, it is a public license (with several restrictments), which you can read at my [github repo](https://github.com/cajemam/ZECertAuthPanel).

## How can you start using this beta version?
